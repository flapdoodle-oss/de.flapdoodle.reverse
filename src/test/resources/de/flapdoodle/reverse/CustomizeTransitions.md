# Customize Transitions

You may start to create a solution based on single transitions as 
in the following example. This could be a backup application:

```java
${writeFilesToBackup}
```

You can avoid names if you just use many types to express the different results of
your application. Most of the time these types are just wrapper:

```java
${ListOfFiles.java}
```

```java
${BackupFolderName.java}
```

You can create your own implementation of an transition:

```java
${WriteBackup.java}
```

... which has `BackupID` as result: 

```java
${BackupID.java}
```

But if you want to customize this, you have to change the code which creates all
these transitions. If you want to create a library any customization is very limited.

As your application consists of more or less independent parts it would be helpful if
one can change only some parts and reuse most of the other parts. 
One way to do this: create a class whith all these parts:

```java
${BackupApp.java}
```
           
This way you can just use it:

```java
${callBackupApp}
```

... or customize it with inheritance:

```java
${callBackupAppWithOverride}
```

... or customize it using code generated by (immutables.org)[immutables.org]:

```java
${callBackupAppWithBuilderPattern}
```
